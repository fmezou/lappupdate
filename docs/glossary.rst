        the script). By definition, a hook script is optional and may be not
        exist.

        .. note::

            a hook script name is hard coded in the caller script, so the name
            is considered like a reserved keyword and cannot be modified.

    Public script
        Public scripts are those that you can use, with the commitment to avoid
        backward incompatible changes (i.e. specially with the command line
        options).

    Non-public script
        Non-public scripts are those that are not intended to be used by third
        parties, so these scripts may change or even removed.
