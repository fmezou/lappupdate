Catalog Format
==============

The catalog is a file which is automatically generated, and **must not be
manually modified**. It contains the applications database and specifies the
following properties, for each application, using the JavaScript Object Notation
(JSON), specified by :rfc:`7159`. The :mod:`lapptrack` script uses this
database to build the input files used by the ``lappdeploy`` script.

The constant `lapptrack.CATALOG_FNAME` specifies the file name of the catalog
and it's located in the 'store' folder (see item ``store`` in the
`lapptrack-userguide_lapptrack-ini-core-section` of the :command:`lapptrack`
configuration file).

The catalog contains several level of nested objects. The root level contains
the metadata of the database and the main object.

================    ============================================================
__version__         is the version number of the catalog scheme.
__warning__         is a warning message reminding that the content must not be
                    modified.
modified            is the date of the latest modification expressed in the
                    :rfc:`3339` format.
products            is an object specifying the list of handled application as
                    described in the configuration file (see ``--configfile``).
================    ============================================================

Each item of the products list is a 3-tuple specifying the deployment state of
the application.

================    ============================================================
pulled              indicate that the editor of the application has published an
                    update or a new major version.
fetched             indicate that an update or a new major version of the
                    application has been fetched. At this step, the system
                    administrator must approved the version before its
                    deployment (see ``--approve``)
approved            indicate that the system administrator approved the
                    deployment of the update or the new version. This version
                    will be added in the `applist` file (see ``--make``) to be
                    deployed.
================    ============================================================

Each item of the 3-tuple is an object containing the attributes of the
application as described in :class:`~cots.core.BaseProduct`.
