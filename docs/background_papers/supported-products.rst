.. sidebar:: Deployment Plan

    A deployment plan should consider the three following issues:

    1. making a installation without any user intervention, i.e. making a
       `silent install`
    2. setting a default configuration in line with your use cases
    3. distributing security patches, new features or versions

The following topics provide background papers for all the products that
`lapptrack` currently supports. Theses topics introduce installers features or
tools that can be used to *deploy* the following products and centrally manages
their configuration in small organisations. It also describes the mechanism used
to notify users and distribute updates (security patches, full version...) and
what `lapptrack` uses to track it.
