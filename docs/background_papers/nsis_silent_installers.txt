Silent installers are installers which **require no user intervention** and
**have no user interface**. The user doesn't see any dialog and isn't asked any
questions. (see `Silent Installers/Uninstallers <http://nsis.sourceforge.net
/Docs/Chapter4.html#silent>`_ for more details).

NSIS installers can be both silent and not silent. The more useful method to
make an installer silent is passing ``/S`` on the installers command line
(case sensitive)
