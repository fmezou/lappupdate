LAppTrack Developer Guide

.. sectionauthor:: Frédéric MEZOU <frederic.mezou@free.fr>

This manual is designed for a *developer audience* to enhance features or to add
plug-in to handle new products. This documentation describes data, classes and
scripts composing the LAppTrack part.

The **LAppTrack** part is written only in Python, and it composed of several
components. The main component is a script (:mod:`lapptrack`) in charge of the
user interface (in text mode), plug-in handling and operations scheduling. The
bulk of the LAppTrack part consists of a collection of python modules grouped
in a package (:mod:`cots`). Each of these modules tracks a :term:`product` based
on the editor's information sources and fetches the updates.
