"""
This module specifies the metadata of the project to avoid duplicating theses
values across sources files. Itâ€™s one of the technique proposed in the
`Single-sourcing the Project Version`_  of the `Python Packaging User Guide`_.

The easiest way to use is to import the module as below.

>>> from version import __version__
>>> __version__
'0.1.0-dev.0'

>>> from version import *
>>> __license__
'GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007'
