# History of lAppUpdate

At the beginning, I searched a means to deploy application for my two personal
pc from a home server (based on [freenas][1]). My searches led me to the
following products:

  * [OCS Inventory NG][2]: it's a good choice for IT professional who manages thousands of PC, and an agent must be deployed on every PC.
  * Active Directory GPO: you can do this with a Windows Server or a server with [Samba configured in domain controller mode][3]. The main constraint is that GPO accept only MSI package.

So I choose to develop my own deployment system built around two main module :
the first one, named [appdeploy][4], deploys application, the second one,
named [appdownload][5], checks and downloads applications' updates if any (or
the full installation package).

# Requirements

The requirements for this project were:

  * [appdeploy][4] must run on windows 7 without prerequisites (I.e. no agent must be prior installed). Theses implies that this modules must be written in [Command shell][6] or [Windows Script Host][7].
  * [appdeploy][4] must run from a network share (aka from a UNC path) or a removable disk (CD or DVD, USB stick...).
  * [appdeploy][4] must work with any type of installation package (MSI package, EXE package or a classic distribution with files and a setup.exe).
  * [appdeploy][4] must have pre install and post installation hook to customize the start menu or install additional packs (e.g. Firefox extension, VirtualBox Extension Pack, Tortoise Language Pack...)
