# History of lAppUpdate

At the beginning, I searched a way to deploy application for my two personal
pc from a home server (based on [freenas](http://www.freenas.org/)). My
searches led me to the following products:

  * [OCS Inventory NG](http://www.ocsinventory-ng.org/en/): it's a good choice for IT professional who manages thousands of PC, and an agent must be deployed on every PC.
  * Active Directory GPO: you can do this with a Windows Server or a server with [Samba configured in domain controller mode](https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Samba_AD_DC_HOWTO). The main constraint is that GPO only accepts MSI package.
  * updaters family ([Avast Software Updater](https://www.avast.com/f-software-updater), [FileHippo App Manager](http://filehippo.com/download_app_manager) (formerly FileHippo Update Checker)...): theses tools are well designed for home PC connected to internet, but they mix the two following functions (checking the availability of updates from the editor web site, checking installed local applications). In my point of view, theses function must be separated to consider the case where target PC are not connected or the need to centralise custom software updates.

So I choose to develop my own deployment system built around two main module :
the first one, named lappdeploy, deploys application, the second one, named
lapptrack, checks and downloads applications updates if any (or the full
installation package).

# Requirements

The requirements for this project were:

  * lappdeploy must run on windows 7 without prerequisites (I.e. no agent must be prior installed). Theses implies that this modules must be written in [Command shell](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc754340.aspx#BKMK_OVR) or [Windows Script Host](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/d1wf56tt.aspx).
  * lappdeploy must run from a network share (aka from a UNC path) or a removable disk (CD or DVD, USB stick...).
  * lappdeploy must work with any type of installation package (MSI package, EXE package or a classic distribution with files and a setup.exe).
  * lappdeploy must have pre install and post installation hook to customize the start menu or install additional packs (e.g. Firefox extension, ~VirtualBox Extension Pack, Tortoise Language Pack...)
