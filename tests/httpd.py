This module implement a simple HTTP server designed for testing purpose.

It may use as a module by a third party offering a new GUI for example, or as a
script with the command line interface::

    python -m httpd

``httpd.py``


Description
-----------
This HTTP server accepts some special requests and returns either an error code
or data with specific HTTP headers.

    Mocker HTTP request handler.

    This handler overwrite the `SimpleHTTPRequestHandler.send_head` method to
    altering the HTTP Headers. For this, the following virtual resources are
    defined:

    * *error*: this resource returns the HTTP error sp√©cified by the code
      parameter (/error?code=500 for example)
    * *nolength*: this resource return the content of default file (lorem.txt)
      with no Content-Length header.
    * *notype*: this resource return the content of default file (lorem.txt)
      with no Content-Type header.
    * *increaselen*: this resource return the content of default file (lorem.txt)
      with Content-Length header increased (the real content length do not
      change).
    * *decreaselen*: this resource return the content of default file (lorem.txt)
      with Content-Length header decreased (the real content length do not
      change).

    In other cases, this serves files from the current directory and any of its
    subdirectories (topic `http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler` details the
    behaviour).
