%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Lightweight application update (commonly known as lAppUpdate) is a set of
scripts to download and deploy application on a small network of computers or
standalone computers running under Microsoft Windows.

It built around two main parts: the first one, named **appdeploy**, deploys
application from a removable media or a shared folder; the second one, named
**appdownload**, tracks and downloads application installers or its updates.
